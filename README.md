## Data Assumptions

- The app fetches data from public Parivahan dashboard APIs.
- API responses may change; parsing logic assumes current JSON structures.
- Data includes vehicle registrations, revenue, and trends by year, quarter, and month.
- No personally identifiable information is processed.
- All data is for informational and visualization purposes only.

---

## Notes

- If API endpoints or data formats change, update the parsing functions in `vahan/parsing.py`.
- For troubleshooting, use the debug expanders in the app to inspect raw API responses.
